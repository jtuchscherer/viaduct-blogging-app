  id: ID!
  username: String!
  email: String!
  name: String!
  posts: [Post!]!
  createdAt: String!
}

type Post {
  id: ID!

  id: ID!
  user: User!
  post: Post!
  createdAt: String!
}
```

### Queries

type Query {
  posts: [Post!]!
  post(id: ID!): Post
  myPosts: [Post!]!
  me: User
}
```

### Mutations
```graphql
type Mutation {
  createPost(title: String!, content: String!): Post!
  updatePost(id: ID!, title: String, content: String): Post!
  deletePost(id: ID!): Boolean!

```

## React Frontend Structure

### Components
- `App.tsx` - Main app with routing and protected routes
- `Header.tsx` - Navigation header with auth state and user menu
- `AuthContext.tsx` - React context for authentication state management

### Pages
- `/` - Home page (HomePage.tsx) - Display all posts with like counts
- `/login` - Login page (LoginPage.tsx) - Username/password authentication
- `/register` - Registration page (RegisterPage.tsx) - New user signup
- `/create` - Create post page (CreatePostPage.tsx) - Protected route
- `/edit/:id` - Edit post page (EditPostPage.tsx) - Protected route, author only
- `/post/:id` - Post detail page (PostDetailPage.tsx) - View post with comments and likes
- `/my-posts` - My posts page (MyPostsPage.tsx) - Protected route, user's posts

### Key Libraries
- **React Router** - Client-side routing with protected routes
- **Apollo Client** - GraphQL client with authentication middleware
- **Vite** - Fast build tool and dev server
- **TypeScript** - Type safety throughout the application

### Features
- **Authentication**: JWT token stored in localStorage, auto-included in GraphQL requests
- **Protected Routes**: Redirect to login for authenticated-only pages
- **Real-time Updates**: Apollo Client cache management for instant UI updates
- **Error Handling**: User-friendly error messages throughout
- **Loading States**: Visual feedback during async operations
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile devices

## Authentication System

### Backend (Kotlin/Ktor REST API)
- Username/password authentication with salted SHA-256 hashing
- JWT token generation and validation
- REST endpoints: `/auth/register`, `/auth/login`, `/auth/me`
- Runs on port 8081 alongside Viaduct GraphQL

### Password Security
- SHA-256 hashing with random salt
- Salt stored separately in database
- Password verification using constant-time comparison

### Frontend Integration
- JWT token stored in localStorage
- Apollo Client middleware automatically includes token in Authorization header
- React Context manages authentication state across the app
- Login/logout handled with immediate state updates

### Authentication Flow
1. User registers/logs in via REST API (`POST /auth/register` or `/auth/login`)
2. Backend validates credentials and returns JWT token + user info
3. Frontend stores token in localStorage and user in React Context
4. Apollo Client automatically includes token in all GraphQL requests
5. GraphQL resolvers extract JWT from header and verify for protected operations
6. User info passed through Viaduct's `ExecutionInput.requestContext` to resolvers

## Implementation Roadmap

## Getting Started

### Quick Start (Recommended)
```bash
./start.sh
```

This single command will:
1. Build the backend
2. Install frontend dependencies
3. Start all services (GraphQL, Auth, Frontend)

Then open **http://localhost:5173** in your browser.

### Manual Start
See `QUICKSTART.md` for detailed instructions and troubleshooting.

### Running Tests
```bash
# Backend e2e tests
./e2e-test.sh

# Backend unit tests
./gradlew test
```
